									<p>Like many IT professionals, I have been working remotely for the past two years. I currently reside in A Coruna, northern Spain. However, I make frequent trips back to England to see my family. My current position finishes mid-May 2022, so, Im actively looking for another remote job that allows me to continue being able to work from both areas as my situation dictates.  </p>

									<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
									<p> When my eyes are not clued to my computer monitor, engulfed in my latest project, I enjoy a vast number of activities. Being outdoors engaging with friends and nature is always 
										a great escape for my mind. Others that come to mind. 

										<ol>  
										<li>Gaming</li>
										<li>History</li>
										<li>Music</li>
										<li>Travel</li>
										<li>Sports</li>
										<ul>
										<li>Football</li>
										<li>Padel (Spanish Tennis)</li>
										<li>Surfing</li>
										<li>Swimming</li>
										<li>Climbing</li>
											</ul>
										</ol>

										

										<p>I've been fortunate enough to write and produce music with Sony signed artist, Samm Henshaw. The song is called, 'Better'. Its accumulated a lot of royalties over the 
										past few years that's help me invest in my home music studio. Having music played in many countries on various radio stations is something I always pursued and strived for.</p> 
										
										<p>Achieving goals you set yourself and visualizing the result is how 
										I function in all my endeavours and hasn't failed me yet.
									Due to my past in the music industry, I play a number of instruments, Guitar, Piano and Drums. I still write and produce music from time to time and play with other musicians in my local area.</p>

									<h2>Future Goals</h2>

									<p> I have currently been learning HTML to help me in gain another skill, whilst opening the door to an already familiar world of coding. 
										From this i plan to learn Javascript (react), CSS and python. The Idea is to learn these coding languages through code academy or Udemy. 
										I'm currently halfway though my AWS - Cloud practitioner course on Udemy. Also through my current work position I'm familiar with JSON and have 
										expanded my knowledge of that through LinkedIn learning.</p>

										<p>The end goal is to work remotely in an programming environment. As my current work contract comes to an end, I will be seeking positions that not only let my make an 
										impact with my already vast and strong skill set but also allow me to grow and develop into the world of programming. </p>
