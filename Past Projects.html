										<p>Currently understanding HTML code to create this site and plan to continue to build on this... Adding audio from past music releases,
											 Updates of current home/work projects including basic app building to home renovation.

												<h3>Website Build</h3>
												<p>Whilst my current contract at synamedia is coming to an end and the 2 year project completed successfully, I found myself wanting to increase my knowledge base of coding/programming.
													I've undertaken the idea to create a profile website to display my skills and attributes. 
												</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Website Build Process</h3>
												<p>I chose a standard boiler plate template from HTML5 UP site. A great handy site that displays fully responsive templates of different 
													styles and themes. Here's the <a href="https://html5up.net/"><u>Link.</u></a></p>
													<p>Once customised via Visual Studio Code (Also Free) I decided to host the website on Github Pages. After researching many options (paid vs non-paid) Github
														was by far one of the top free hosting sites. 
												</p>

												<h3>Escalations Team</h3>
												<p>Whilst undertaking my first support role at a busy service desk environment in a well-known company called 'Specsavers', I was promoted to the Escalations Team. 
													The primary objective was to assess the major incidents also the longest outstanding incidents and bring them to resolution.   </p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Computer Building</h3>
												<p> Down below I have listed out my home office Kit. I got into PC building in early 2020. Mostly watching Linus Techtips on youtube
													I managed to build my first PC which I love... This led to requests to build my brother a Gaming PC and my mum to build her Ultimate 
													Purple Office Computer... totally over-powered but that's before the spike in prices for EVERYTHING. 
													
													
												</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
												<h3>Future Projects</h3>
												<p>Im currently learning HTML through building this website. CSS and Javascript. I would relish the opportunity to work for a company that would have me writing code 
													on a daily basis. However, until that day arrives I plan to create some beginner projects... Im thinking; Calculator, Chessboard or a To-do List. Start small, finish big.

													<h3>Service Assurance Team</h3>
													<p>What started as a 6-month contractor role quickly turned into a 2 and a half year project.
													Check out their website via this <a href="https://www.synamedia.com/">link</a>.</p>

													<p>What started as a 6 month contractor role quickly turned into a 2 and a half year project. The objective was to create
													from scratch an entire SaaS support
													infrastructure. Named 'Service Assurance' we set our sights on implementing ITIL framework for Incidents, Problems and
													Changes. The team of 18 provided 24hr support
													for 5 video streaming companies such as Vodafone, COX, Etisalat and YES. These are all international companies thus each
													process and SLA agreement was different.</p>

														<dd>
															<p>"Peter has been an invaluable member of the team this year. He has been a vital part in the training of Andrea, as well
															as writing a lot of the training and documentation that the L1 team uses on a daily basis. It has been a pleasure to
															work with Peter this year."</p>
														</dd>
														<dt>Rachel Thomas - Major Incident Manager</dt>
												<dd>
															<p>"I want to acknowledge all the effort you have made over the past year to improve things not just for your self but for
															the whole team, you have seen gaps in training, documentation etc and you have highlighted it so improvements can be
															made.<br>
															
															<br>I want you to know that it hasn't gone unnoticed and is greatly appreciated, I always consider you to be one of my go-to
															people that I know I can rely on. Thanks!"</p>

															<p>"All the training Peter has done with me has been very helpful, being my lighthouse during the past months (and still
															today).<br>
															
															<br>It's always nice when, at the end of the handover, before dropping off the call, he always asks me "do you have any
															questions?" (because he knows I always have many).<br>
															
															<br>I feel pretty lucky in having him as a teammate because he's ambitious and focused, he always knows what's going on with
															everything: this behaviour of him helps me in improving."</p>
